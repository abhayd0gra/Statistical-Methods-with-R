# Statistical-Methods-with-R

This repository contains the R code for a couple of projects performed using the statistical methods of Regression Analysis and ANOVA.
The purpose of these project was to:
1. Model Average Rent Prices Across States in the U.S.A. using Regression Analysis. 
2. Evaluating Relationship Between Economic Progress and Climate Change Across Countries Using 2-Factor ANOVA


Project 1:
The objective being to test the hypothesis - if Average Rent of a 1-Bedroom House is affected linearly by Median Household Income. 
A second objective is to create a model for Average Rent of a 1-Bedroom House vs socioeconomic variables to find which factors are responsible for the rent prices across Americaâ€™s states.


Project 2:
The objective is to test the claim that there is significant difference in GDP increase between High, Medium and Low levels of CO2 increase, and between High, Medium and Low levels of temperature increase.
